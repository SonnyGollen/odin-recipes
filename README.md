The goal of this project is to build my own recipes website using just HTML. This project will help to learn and reinforce all the things I've learnt for the HTML section of The Odin Project.

HTML learnings that will be included:

- Elements and Tags
- Boilerplate content
- Working with text
- Lists
- Links and images
